# Xaero_Fair-Play_Enforcer
A very simple and very light weight plugin that's meant to send all players the strings that the Xaero's Minimap and World Map mods need for enabling Fair Play modes on the full versions.

Strings are sent to the player's client when...
- ...they join your server
- ...they switch worlds
- ...or you run `/xfpe force`

# In development
This project is very much still in it's alpha stages. There will be bugs. They will be squished in due time. Issues will be opened once first major version is published.
